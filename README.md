## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to give to all my flex elements the same width using the flex property.

```css
.layout-grid > *{
    flex: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn CSS, how to write sustainable CSS code and good practices.


### Useful resources

- [Responsive layout - Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFbxl_VmIx0) - This helped me to organize my container using flexbox method.
